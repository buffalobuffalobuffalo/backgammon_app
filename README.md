# backgammon_app
* This repo will, eventually, have a mobile app that allows a user to:
    1. take a photo of a backgammon board
    1. process and transform that image into a standardized format representing the position
    1. evaluate the board position to determine win expectancy for both parties
    1. evaluate point expectancy (as this can be a distinct value when taking into account gammon and backgammon likelihood)
    1. offer doubling advice
    1. provide the top n moves for a given roll from that position
* I am building this project to learn how to use and incorporate several of the component parts, so I welcome any and all advice and criticism
